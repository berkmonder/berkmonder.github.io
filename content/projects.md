## Semi-Supervised Learning

- Image Classification and Object Recognition: Improve the accuracy of models by combining a small set of labeled images with a larger set of unlabeled images.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enhance the performance of language models and classifiers by combining a small set of labeled text data with a vast amount of unlabeled text.
- Speech Recognition: Improve the accuracy of speech recognition by leveraging a limited amount of transcribed speech data and a more extensive set of unlabeled audio.
- Recommendation Systems: Improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations by supplementing a sparse set of user-item interactions (labeled data) with a wealth of unlabeled user behavior data.
- Healthcare and Medical Imaging: Enhance medical image analysis by utilizing a small set of labeled medical images alongside a larger set of unlabeled images.
